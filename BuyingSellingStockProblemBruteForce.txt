//Writing the program in notepad with whatever knowledge I have of C# as of now

//The stock value varies everyday. It has a Value S at a particular day.
//Given a range of days, what is the maximum profit that can be earned by buying and selling the stock.

//Example range: 11 5 8 6 7 9
//Answer: Buying at day 2 (5) selling at day 6 (9) = 4
